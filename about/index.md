## Me
Hi there! I'm a final-year student studying information engineering. 
I'm also an individual who loves to play badminton, 
listen to music, and read books. In addition to these interests,
My current area of focus is AI models and algorithms, and I am always eager to 
learn more about this exciting field. Whether I'm playing a game of badminton, 
enjoying my favorite tunes, or delving into my latest research, 
I am constantly seeking new opportunities for personal and professional growth.

## This Site
My initial motivation for writing on this website was to share the insights 
I had garnered through my experiences and learning. I had greatly benefited from 
reading thought-provoking blogs, and I saw this as an opportunity to conclude and 
summarize what I have learnt. Publishing my notes on this platform provided me with 
a sense of motivation and satisfaction.

Additionally, I discovered that this website could serve as a visual representation 
of my professional qualifications and the skills I had acquired. It offered tangible 
proof of the knowledge and abilities I had gained over time.
